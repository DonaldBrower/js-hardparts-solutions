/*
Write a function delayCounter that accepts a number (called 'target') as the first argument and a number of milliseconds (called 'wait') as the second argument, and returns a function.

When the returned function is invoked, it should log to the console all of the numbers between 1 and the target number, spaced apart by 'wait' milliseconds.
